# Unit 27: Computational Geometry
This unit is an introduction to Computational Geometry, the art of solving complex geometrical problems with computer programs. Although it is not currently a mandatory topic to study for IOI, it is good to have some basics since it has interesting algorithms and is an increasingly important topic in ACM-ICPC (if you plan to continue algorithmics in university).

The theory covered is:
- Basics of 2D geometry
- Useful formulas
- Handling floiting point errors
- Polygons, area, convexity, check if inside
- Convex hull

## Prerequisites
- Secondary-school synthetic geometry (years 1 and 2)
- Unit 1: [Complexity](../01-complexity)
- Unit 3: [Sorting](../03-sorting) (just using a sort function with comparator)

## Practice problems
